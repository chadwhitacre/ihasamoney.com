This is the ihasamoney.com website.

The first step is to install and prepare Postgres. There's a little script at
sql/reset.sh which will run the *.sql files in that directory. NB: 0000.sql
TRIES TO KILL YOUR IHAZMONEY DATABASE! It will fail if there are open
connections to the db from a running instance of the app, psql, pgAdmin, etc.
Also, these *.sql files don't do anything with roles. Take care of that
yourself by tweaking the reset.sh file as needed, etc.

Next create a local.env file in this directory that contains the following
(tweak for your environment):

    DATABASE_URL=postgres://{user}:{password}@localhost:5432/ihasamoney
    CANONICAL_HOST=
    CANONICAL_SCHEME=http
    GAUGES=false
    SALT=password some unguessable salt

Now `make run` in this directory, and hit http://localhost:8080/. Voila! You
haz money. Sign in using admin@ihasamoney.com, password 'so secret'.

Download transactions from Mint to a file named transactions.csv in this
directory. The link on Mint is at the very bottom of the "Transactions" screen
and says something like "Export all NNN transactions". Then import them into
admin@ihasamoney.com using the "import" tool in this directory (the swaddle tool
runs a command using environment variables from a file):

    $ . env/bin/activate
    [ihasamoney]$ ./swaddle local.env ./import
