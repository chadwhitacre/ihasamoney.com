Download transactions from Mint to a file named transactions.csv in this
directory. The link on Mint is at the very bottom of the "Transactions" screen
and says something like "Expert all NNN transactions".

Next create a local.env file in this directory that contains the following:

    CANONICAL_HOST=
    CANONICAL_SCHEME=http
    GAUGES=false

Then run `make run` in this directory and hit http://localhost/

Voila!
